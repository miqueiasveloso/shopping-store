# 🛒 Shopping Store – React E-Commerce UI

A stylish and functional **shopping store interface** built with **React**. This was my **first React project** and a major milestone following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

It features product listings, a shopping cart with add/remove functionality, and seamless page navigation using **React Router** — all wrapped in a clean, user-friendly design.

> 💡 Built with ❤️ to explore React fundamentals like components, props, state, routing, and conditional rendering.
